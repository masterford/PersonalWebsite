         <h2>Why Do Cats Like Boxes?</h2>
         <p>"Cats like boxes because they are cryptic animals; they like to hide," Stephen Zawistowski, science adviser for the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told Business Insider. "And a box gives them a place of safety and security."</p>
         <p>While inside a box, cats feel that they cannot be snuck up on from behind or the side â€” anything that wants to approach them must come directly into their field of vision. In effect, such hiding spaces allow them to watch the world around them without being seen.</p>
