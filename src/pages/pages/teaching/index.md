The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence

Born in Accra, Ghana and raised in Harare, Zimbabwe. I just graduated with a double major BSE in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania.  I am very passionate about technology, both hardware and software and I enjoy merging my interests in these two disciplines to create meaningful projects. 
I'm an aspiring entrepreneur and obsessed with the African Entrepreneurial ecosystem.
