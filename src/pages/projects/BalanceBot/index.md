description: "We assembled our balance bot from scratch, using a beaglebone microcontroller and a battery pack as well as other mechanical parts. While the PID tuning was mostly pre-programmed, we adjusted our tuning constants and programmed race functionality."

We tricked out our balance bot and programmed race control algorithms and placed top 5 in a class of 20+ teams for fastest track completion time (our time was 27 seconds with the slowest team taking +180 seconds and fastest 10 seconds).

Understanding how PID works, and being able to incorporate it into larger systems will prove to be a catalyst towards effective control in a future characterized by system controls innovations.
