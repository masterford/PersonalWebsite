In a recent interview on the Lex Fridman podcast, Jack Dorsey CEO of Twitter stated that "Payments is probably the number one problem to solve across the continent" when talking about a conversation he had with an Ethiopian Entrepreneur. Africa as a continent has some of the most successful mobile-phone-based financial service, with Kenya's M-Pesa platform leading the way. Yet despite the proliferation of mobile money there are still a vast number of people that remain unbanked. This project aims to explore the state of financial services within East Africa, specifically Tanzania and Kenya.<br> Features included: <ul><li>Data Wrangling</li><li>Building a binary classifier using stochastic gradient descent</li><li>Advanced SQL queries
